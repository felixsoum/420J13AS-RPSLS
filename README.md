For your final project, you will design and implement artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to play simple games. These algorithms will be tested and scored against dummy algorithms and also submissions from other students. Your AI will be simple at first, but at every seasonal iteration it must improve and adapt to new requirements and harder opponents.

## Season 3
The third season aims at designing a competent AI that is able to beat medium opponents. Students will learn a frequency counting algorithm as a good starting strategy.

## Season 2
The second week aims at designing a basic AI that is able to beat simple opponents. Students that wish to further challenge themselves can attempt to beat other students at the leaderboard to obtain bonus points.

## Season 1
The first week is dedicated to setting up your environment properly and getting ready to start working on your AI. Your AI is not expected to have any strategy at this point. The goal is simply to understand and prepare your working environment.
