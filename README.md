For your final project, you will design and implement artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to play simple games. These algorithms will be tested and scored against dummy algorithms and also submissions from other students. Your AI will be simple at first, but at every iteration it must improve and adapt to new requirements and harder opponents.

## Week 1
The first week is dedicated to setting up your environment properly and getting ready
to start working on your AI. Your AI is not expected to have any strategy at this point.
The goal is simply to understand and prepare your working environment.
